# Test Driven Development

There is no real evidence apart from that each person tested the code on their own machine (this was done using local servers with the help of XAMP) before uploading it onto GitHub. From there, the code was downloaded and tested by other members and then merged with the release branch before being committed to the master at the end of the sprint. 

The code was also compared to the DoD to make sure all tasks have been completed to an acceptable level.
