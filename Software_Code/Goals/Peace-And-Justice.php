        <p>
          The main goal is to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, prove access to
          justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
        </p>
        <p>
          The world is still a long way from achieving the goal of building peaceful, just and inclusive societies, with
          millions of people living in fragile and conflict-affected States. At the end of 2019, 79.5 million people had
          been forcibly displaced worldwide, equivalent to 1 per cent of the global population.
        </p>
        <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed inequalities and discrimination and has tested, weakened, and in some cases
          shattered rights and protection systems in countries and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Globally, around 437,000 people were victims of homicide in 2019. However, lethal violence is slowly
          decreasing, and homicide rates declined from 6 v ictims per 100,000 population in 2015 to 5.7 per 100,000 in
          2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two thirds of all homicide victims were in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, with no
          sign of numbers falling in sub-Saharan Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The United Nations recorded 69,276 civilian deaths in 12 of the worldâ€™s deadliest armed conflicts between 2018
          and 2020. In 2020, there were five civilians killed per 100,000 population, one in seven of which was a woman
          or child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even before the pandemic, violence against children was widespread, affecting victims regardless of wealth or
          social status. In 77 mostly low- and middle-income countries and territories with available data from 2012 to
          2020, 8 in 10 children, ranging from 1 to 14 years of age, had been subjected to some form of psychological
          aggression or physical punishment at home in the previous month.
