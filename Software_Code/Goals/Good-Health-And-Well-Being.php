          The main goal of this development goal is to promote living a healthy live and well-being for all ages.

          According to data from the period 2014–2020, 83 per cent of births worldwide were assisted by skilled health
          professionals, including medical doctors, nurses and midwives, an increase from 71 per cent in the period from
          2007 to 2013. The COVID-19 pandemic may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt
          maternity health services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world has made substantial progress towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths, with the global
          under-5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019. The global
          neonatal mortality rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000 live births in the same period. Even with such
          progress, 5.2 million children died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, with almost half of those
          deaths, 2.4 million, occurring in the first month of life. While the full impact of the pandemic on child
          survival is not yet known, significant disruption to the continued provision of life-saving interventions
          could stall or even reverse the progress made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who have their family planning needs met by
          modern contraceptive methods has remained steady at around 77 per cent between 2015 and 2021, reaching only 56
          per cent in sub -Saharan Africa and 52 per cent in Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zealand. The ongoing
          pandemic may lead to reductions in these figures as a result of supply-chain disruptions and decreased access
          to family planning services, while the fertility intentions and family planning needs among women of
          reproductive age may also change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The global adolescent birth rate has fallen from 56 births per 1,000 adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age in
          2000 to 45 births per 1,000 adolescents in 2015 and 41 per 1,000 in 2020. The declines varied considerably
          across regions, with the largest decrease in Central and Southern Asia from 70 births per 1,000 adolescents in
          2000 to 24 births per 1,000 in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immunization is one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. While vaccination
          coverage among infants increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 before stalling until 2019,
          an estimated 19.7 million children did not receive essential vaccines during the first year of their life in
          2019. In addition, global coverage levels for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to
          significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia, have yet to reach 50 per cent. Measles is a highly contagious
          disease, and the 71 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine in 2019 was insufficient to prevent outbreaks of
          measles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvements in essential health services, as measured by the universal health coverage service coverage
          index, increased from a global average of 45 out of 100 in the year 2000 to 66 in 2017. Low-income countries
          and territories experienced the greatest progress, driven mainly by interventions for infectious diseases.
          However, the pace of progress has slowed since 2010, and the poorest countries and territories and those
          affected by conflict are generally lagging furthest behind. The COVID-19 pandemic is derailing progress even
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the pandemic, an estimated 927 million people, or 12.7 per cent of the global population, made
          out-of-pocket health-care payments amounting to more than 10 per cent of their household budgets, and for 209
          million people, or 3 per cent, their share of health-care spending exceeded 25 per cent of their household
          budgets, posing an even greater threat to spending on other essential goods and services such as food and
          education.
        </p>
        <p>
          ODA for basic health from all official donors has increased by 59 per cent in real terms since 2010, reaching
          $11 billion in 2019. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Gavi Alliance and the United
          States of America accounted for more than half of that total, providing $2.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8
          billion, respectively. In 2019, $3.4 billion was spent on basic health care, $2.2 billion on infectious
          disease control, excluding HIV/AIDS, and $2.2 billion on malaria control.
        </p>

          Health workers are on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Countries and territories, especially
          those with a limited health workforce, are further constrained with regard to the delivery of essential health
          services. On the basis of data from the period 2013–2018, the density of nursing and midwifery personnel in
          Northern America is more than 150 per 10,000 population, which is more than 15 times that in sub-Saharan
          African and 8 times that in Northern Africa and Southern Asia. The density of medical doctors in Northern
          America, Oceania and Central Asia remains around 25 per 10,000 population, compared to 2 per 10,000 population
          in sub-Saharan African.
