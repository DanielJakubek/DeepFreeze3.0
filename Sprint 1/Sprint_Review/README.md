# Sprint 1 Review

Notes taken during the sprint review:

- The dots on the maps need to be made easier to see.
- It should be possible to click on a listing of points to go there on the map.
- The text in each page should be laid out as a header followed by a "read more" section. In particular, the map ought to be visible immediately without the need to scroll down.
- A map should be added to the front page. (we can add this to the footer and add a filter).
- The front page could use something bright and colourful rather than being black and white.
